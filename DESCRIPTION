Description: The website https://www.oddsportal.com provides historical data for the outcomes of various sport events and the betting odds associated with them. The website is dynamically generated, which makes it difficult to scrape the data from it. `oddor` provides functions to scrape this data and stores some popular competitions data within the package, ready to be used in R.
